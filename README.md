# Improving speech enhancement models with neural post processing

Tensorflow implementation of a neural post processing network for speech enhancement. Firstly creating tfrecords with around 100mb per file to avoid data bottlenecks. Then training online on a high performance cluster and evaluate different models by predicting speech files and listening to them. When published, the Paper shall be linked here.
